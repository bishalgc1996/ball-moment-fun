README for Ball Movement Project in JavaScript

Overview:
This project simulates the movement of a ball in a 2D plane. The ball is subject to various forces such as gravity, air resistance, and friction with the ground. The user can adjust the parameters of these forces and observe the resulting trajectory of the ball. The project is implemented using the JavaScript programming language and utilizes the HTML5 canvas for graphical display.

Getting Started:

Ensure that you have a recent version of a modern web browser, such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Microsoft Edge.
Download or clone the project from the GitHub repository.
Open the project folder in a text editor such as Visual Studio Code or Atom.
Usage:

Open the index.html file in a web browser.
A canvas will appear displaying the simulation of the ball.
The user can adjust the parameters of the forces by modifying the constants in the constants.js file.
The user can also adjust the initial conditions of the ball (such as position, velocity, and acceleration) by modifying the Ball object in the main.js file.
The simulation can be paused/resumed by clicking on the canvas.
The simulation can be restarted by refreshing the web page.
